UIStackView is a way to lay out app user interface elements in iOS 9+ and
Mac.

* [Getting Started with UIStackView](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ios-9-getting-started-with-uistackview--cms-24193)
  along with the companion code in the
  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tutsplus/iOS-StackViewFinishedProject)
  provides a detailed tutorial for laying out elements, including ones
  that are added to the screen at runtime.

* The blog post [a first look at UIStackView in Swift 2.0](http://flexmonkey.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/a-first-look-at-uistackview-in-swift-20.html)
  is a good starter tutorial along with the 
  [StackView GitHub repository](https://github.com/FlexMonkey/StackView)
  example code. Note that the code will not compile with Swift 2.1 but 
  if you fix the error in the way suggested by Xcode you'll be able to 
  run the app without issues.

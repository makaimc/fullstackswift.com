## Web Frameworks
A nascent community of server-side code libraries has sprung up since
Swift was open sourced by Apple at the end of 2015. Most of these frameworks
are not yet intended for production usage but over time some of them will
emerge as favorites to build web applications.

* [Vapor](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor) is a framework inspired by
  Laravel, which is a PHP framework. There is an 
  [example project](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor-example) that
  demonstrates how a simple web application should be built with Vapor.

* [Swifton](https://github.com/necolt/Swifton) is an in-progress Ruby on 
  Rails-inspired framework with routing, controllers, models and views
  similar to the model-view-controller pattern Rails web applications
  use.

* [Kitura](https://developer.ibm.com/swift/products/kitura/) is a web
  framework open sourced by IBM. This framework is intended to be easy to
  use with IBM's Bluemix cloud platform, if that's your kind of thing.

[server-side Swift post](https://medium.com/@LogMaestro/server-side-swift-c965b7ebe6e7)
goes into using Vapor and shows how to deploy a "Hello World" application
on Heroku.

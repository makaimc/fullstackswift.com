## Best Swift Resources
* [NSHipster](http://nshipster.com/) has a wide range of in-depth articles
  on Swift, Objective-C and Cocoa APIs. It is an awesome resource that's
  frequently updated with new articles by many of the best known developers
  in the Swift ecosystem.

* [Awesome Swift](https://github.com/matteocrippa/awesome-swift)
  is yet another "awesome" list but it contains stacks of fantastic links 
  to code libraries and tutorials broken down into categories such as 
  security, user interfaces and dependency management.
